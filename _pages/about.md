Hi! My name is Fagner. I am a PhD candidate at [UFAM](https://www.ufam.edu.br/), supervised by Professor [Eulanda Miranda dos Santos](https://numeros.icomp.ufam.edu.br/eulanda). I develop computer vision solutions for ecological monitoring challenges under real-world constraints, such as those posed by camera-trap data.

My work bridges applied research and real-world problem-solving, addressing challenges like fine-grained classification, extremely imbalanced long-tailed distributions, hierarchical prediction, and domain shift.

I have solid experience in dataset curation, training deep learning models, and optimizing them for embedded systems. I’ve collaborated with institutions such as [Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en), working in [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/)’s group, and the [Mamirauá Institute](https://www.mamiraua.org.br/), combining state-of-the-art deep learning solutions with biodiversity monitoring efforts.
